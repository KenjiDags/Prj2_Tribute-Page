                    <li>Rowan Sebastian Atkinson is an English actor, comedian and writer.</li>
                    <li>Atkinson was born in Consett, County Durham, England, on 6 January 1955.</li>
                    <li>Atkinson's character, Mr. Bean, first appeared on New Year's Day in 1990 in a half-hour special for Thames Television.</li>
                    <li>Atkinson states, "The essence of Mr Bean is that he's entirely selfish and self-centred and doesn't actually acknowledge the outside world. He's a child in a man's body. Which is what most visual comedians are about</li>
                    <li>Several sequels to Mr. Bean appeared on television until 1995, and the character later appeared in a feature film. Bean (1997) was directed by Mel Smith</li>
                    <li>Atkinson's film career began with a supporting part in the James Bond film Never Say Never Again (1983) and a leading role in Dead on Time (also 1983) with Nigel Hawthorne.</li>
